Lingering questions:

How do we track rings / lb?
We want to be able to really "track" servers, we'll need a config file..
Why don't we make a YAML called servers.yml and these commands will affect that YAML
We'll need to get smart about syncing

Let's start by building out:

simp config

What does servers.yml look like?
